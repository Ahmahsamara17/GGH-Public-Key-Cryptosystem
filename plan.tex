- GGH Public Key Cryptosystem

	==== Key Creation ====
1. Choose a good basis v_1,..., v_n
2. Choose an integer matrix U satisfying det(U) = ±1
3. Compute a bad basis w_1,..., w_n as the rows of W = UV
4. Publish the public key w_1,..., w_n


	==== Encryption ====
1. Choose small plaintext vector m.
2. Choose random small vector r
3. Use Alice’s public key to compute e = x_1v_1 + ··· + x_nv_n + r
4. Send the ciphtertext e to Alice


	==== Decryption ====
1. Use Babai’s algorithm to compute the vector v ∈ L closest to e
2. Compute vW−1 to recover m
